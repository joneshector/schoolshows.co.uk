Sue’s annual school plays are truly wonderful! Sue has an amazing ability to see each child’s potential to perform, and with her inspiring and fun filled approach to directing, every child has the opportunity to shine bright on the stage.
As well as directing, Sue has written many original scripts and songs. Her vision for the set on stage and costumes always results in an inspiring and uplifting occasion for children and their parents.

There is nothing more exciting than watching a child truly grow in confidence and enjoy exploring expression through characterisation during rehearsals and finally through performance. This is an area of expertise that Drama Sue excels at. With her many years of writing and directing plays, from The Sword in the Stone to Heracles, Robin Hood and many more, Drama Sue has given her young actors a real taste of the excitement, joy and confidence that comes from an energy created in her rehearsal space that is magic to be involved in for the actors and wonderful to witness as a member of the audience.
